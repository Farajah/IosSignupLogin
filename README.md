# IosSignupLogin
The iOS project offers a comprehensive authentication and registration system powered by Firebase integration, providing users with a secure and seamless experience. Users can register or log in using their email and password credentials, with Firebase handling the authentication process. Stringent validation checks are implemented to ensure passwords are at least 6 characters long and emails are valid, enhancing security. Once logged in, users benefit from persistent login sessions, eliminating the need for repetitive logins. User data, including names, emails, and timestamps, is securely stored in Firestore, with timestamps captured using the timeIntervalSince1970 method. Overall, the project delivers a user-friendly solution that prioritizes security and reliability, leveraging Firebase's robust backend infrastructure for authentication and database management.
